        question: "Can a drain field be repaired, or does it always need replacement?",
        answer:
          "Many drain field problems can be repaired without full replacement. Biomat (a biological crust that blocks absorption) can be treated with aeration or bacterial additives in early stages. Broken pipes can be replaced. Distribution box failures can be corrected. We always look for the least invasive, most cost-effective fix first.",

        question: "How much does drain field repair cost?",
        answer:
          "Costs vary widely depending on the problem. A distribution box replacement may cost a few hundred dollars. Full drain field replacement typically ranges from several thousand to tens of thousands, depending on soil conditions, field size, and local permit requirements. We provide a detailed estimate after assessment.",

      {
        question: "What causes a drain field to fail?",
        answer:
          "Common causes include: overloading the system (too many people, heavy water use), infrequent pumping leading to solids reaching the field, flushing non-biodegradable items, driving vehicles over the field, tree root intrusion, and natural end-of-life after 20–30 years.",
