Done.

**What was done:**

- **Identified gap:** The site had 40 posts covering pumping, costs, inspections, emergencies, and maintenance — but no coverage of septic tank sizing, despite "what size septic tank do I need" and "septic tank sizes" being high-volume, zero-competition-from-existing-content queries.

- **Wrote `septic-tank-size-guide`** (~2,100 words) targeting:
  - `what size septic tank do I need`
  - `septic tank size for 3 bedroom house`
  - `septic tank sizes chart`
  - `1000 gallon vs 1500 gallon septic tank`
  - `how often to pump [X]-gallon septic tank`

- **Content covers:** California code minimums by bedroom count, garbage disposal sizing rules (+50% capacity), the four common residential sizes (750/1000/1500/2000 gal), single vs. two-compartment tanks, how to find your current tank size, signs of an undersized tank, and pump-out frequency by tank size and occupant count.

- TypeScript compiles clean, committed to `main`.
