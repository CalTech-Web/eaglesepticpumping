[2026-02-21 17:34:31] Run #1 starting (model: sonnet)
✅ **Completed**
- Added new Education-category blog post: `septic-system-vs-sewer-system`
- **Title**: "Septic System vs. Sewer System: Key Differences, Costs, and What's Right for Your Home"
- **~1,800 words** covering: how each system works, full cost breakdown (upfront + ongoing), maintenance responsibilities, pros/cons of each, Central Valley-specific guidance, home-buying checklist for septic properties, and septic-to-sewer conversion info
- Targets the high-volume informational query cluster `"septic system vs sewer"` / `"septic vs sewer system"` — a topic completely absent from the site's 38 existing posts
- TypeScript clean, committed as `308296a`

**Why this was the highest-priority goal:** Converting to an informational website means capturing users at the research/education stage. "Septic vs sewer" is one of the most-searched informational questions in this niche — asked by homebuyers, rural property owners, and people moving from cities to the Central Valley — and the site had zero coverage of it.

✅ **Completed**

- Created `components/RecentPosts.tsx` — shows the 3 most recent blog posts as cards with category pill, reading time, title, excerpt, and "Read guide →" links. Matches the blog listing card design (hover state, `line-clamp`, `categoryColors` map). Includes a "View all guides →" link to `/blog`.
- Added `<RecentPosts />` to `app/page.tsx` between `<FAQ />` and `<ContactSection />`
- Committed as Run #25

**Why this was the highest-priority goal:** The homepage was 100% company-focused (services, testimonials, CTA). Adding a "Septic System Guides" section is the most impactful single change for the informational conversion — it signals to every homepage visitor (and to search engines via the homepage's authority) that this site is a knowledge resource, not just a service company. The 40+ blog posts already exist; surfacing them on the homepage was the missing link.

**Run #26 complete.** Here's what was built and committed:

**Goal: Septic System Resource Center at `/resources`**

The site previously had a blog but no clear "this is an educational resource" signal. The new `/resources` page creates a distinct informational hub that separates educational content from service pages.

**What was created (`app/resources/page.tsx`):**
- **6 topical sections** — each color-coded, with curated article cards:
  - Septic System Fundamentals (Education)
  - Maintenance & Pumping
  - Warning Signs & Troubleshooting
  - Costs & Pricing
  - Home Buying & Inspections
  - Repairs & Drain Fields
- **Quick Answers panel** — 6 most-asked homeowner questions answered inline (no need to click through)
- **Central Valley Resources** — regulations, hiring guide, commercial section
- **Emergency CTA strip** + bottom CTA linking to all 39+ guides
- SEO metadata targeting informational queries like "septic system guide"

**Navigation update (`components/Header.tsx`):**
- "Resources" added between About and Blog — visible signal to both users and crawlers that this is an educational resource site, not just a service company
[2026-02-21 17:50:05] Run #2 finished
[2026-02-21 17:50:10] Run #3 starting (model: sonnet)
✅ **Completed**

- Added **"How Does a Septic System Work? A Complete Guide for Homeowners"** (`/blog/how-does-a-septic-system-work`)
  - Category: Education | ~10 min read
  - TypeScript compiled clean, committed to `main`

**Why this was the highest priority:** The site had 25+ posts on maintenance schedules, costs, warning signs, and troubleshooting — but zero foundational content explaining *what a septic system actually is*. "How does a septic system work" is the most-searched informational query in the category and the anchor every other informational post links back to. Without it, the informational pivot was built on a missing foundation.

**Post covers:**
- The two core components (tank + drain field)
- The 3-layer tank process (scum / effluent / sludge)
- The role of anaerobic bacteria and what disrupts them
- Drain field filtration mechanics (physical, biological, chemical)
- 5 system types (conventional, pressure distribution, aerobic, mound, chamber)
- What not to flush and why
- Healthy system signs vs early warning signs
- The 3 homeowner maintenance responsibilities (pump schedule, drain field protection, input control)
