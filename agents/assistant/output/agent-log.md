[2026-02-21 17:34:31] Run #1 starting (model: sonnet)
✅ **Completed**
- Added new Education-category blog post: `septic-system-vs-sewer-system`
- **Title**: "Septic System vs. Sewer System: Key Differences, Costs, and What's Right for Your Home"
- **~1,800 words** covering: how each system works, full cost breakdown (upfront + ongoing), maintenance responsibilities, pros/cons of each, Central Valley-specific guidance, home-buying checklist for septic properties, and septic-to-sewer conversion info
- Targets the high-volume informational query cluster `"septic system vs sewer"` / `"septic vs sewer system"` — a topic completely absent from the site's 38 existing posts
- TypeScript clean, committed as `308296a`

**Why this was the highest-priority goal:** Converting to an informational website means capturing users at the research/education stage. "Septic vs sewer" is one of the most-searched informational questions in this niche — asked by homebuyers, rural property owners, and people moving from cities to the Central Valley — and the site had zero coverage of it.

[2026-02-21 17:42:40] Run #1 starting (model: sonnet)
✅ **Completed**

- Created `components/RecentPosts.tsx` — shows the 3 most recent blog posts as cards with category pill, reading time, title, excerpt, and "Read guide →" links. Matches the blog listing card design (hover state, `line-clamp`, `categoryColors` map). Includes a "View all guides →" link to `/blog`.
- Added `<RecentPosts />` to `app/page.tsx` between `<FAQ />` and `<ContactSection />`
- Committed as Run #25

**Why this was the highest-priority goal:** The homepage was 100% company-focused (services, testimonials, CTA). Adding a "Septic System Guides" section is the most impactful single change for the informational conversion — it signals to every homepage visitor (and to search engines via the homepage's authority) that this site is a knowledge resource, not just a service company. The 40+ blog posts already exist; surfacing them on the homepage was the missing link.

[2026-02-21 17:45:12] Run #2 starting (model: sonnet)
**Run #26 complete.** Here's what was built and committed:

**Goal: Septic System Resource Center at `/resources`**

The site previously had a blog but no clear "this is an educational resource" signal. The new `/resources` page creates a distinct informational hub that separates educational content from service pages.

**What was created (`app/resources/page.tsx`):**
- **6 topical sections** — each color-coded, with curated article cards:
  - Septic System Fundamentals (Education)
  - Maintenance & Pumping
  - Warning Signs & Troubleshooting
  - Costs & Pricing
  - Home Buying & Inspections
  - Repairs & Drain Fields
- **Quick Answers panel** — 6 most-asked homeowner questions answered inline (no need to click through)
- **Central Valley Resources** — regulations, hiring guide, commercial section
- **Emergency CTA strip** + bottom CTA linking to all 39+ guides
- SEO metadata targeting informational queries like "septic system guide"

**Navigation update (`components/Header.tsx`):**
- "Resources" added between About and Blog — visible signal to both users and crawlers that this is an educational resource site, not just a service company
[2026-02-21 17:50:05] Run #2 finished
[2026-02-21 17:50:10] Run #3 starting (model: sonnet)
✅ **Completed**

- Added **"How Does a Septic System Work? A Complete Guide for Homeowners"** (`/blog/how-does-a-septic-system-work`)
  - Category: Education | ~10 min read
  - TypeScript compiled clean, committed to `main`

**Why this was the highest priority:** The site had 25+ posts on maintenance schedules, costs, warning signs, and troubleshooting — but zero foundational content explaining *what a septic system actually is*. "How does a septic system work" is the most-searched informational query in the category and the anchor every other informational post links back to. Without it, the informational pivot was built on a missing foundation.

**Post covers:**
- The two core components (tank + drain field)
- The 3-layer tank process (scum / effluent / sludge)
- The role of anaerobic bacteria and what disrupts them
- Drain field filtration mechanics (physical, biological, chemical)
- 5 system types (conventional, pressure distribution, aerobic, mound, chamber)
- What not to flush and why
- Healthy system signs vs early warning signs
- The 3 homeowner maintenance responsibilities (pump schedule, drain field protection, input control)

[2026-02-21 17:53:47] Run #1 starting (model: sonnet)
✅ **Completed**

- Created `components/HomepageAnswerHub.tsx` — a 6-card "Homeowner Answer Center" grid with questions, blurbs, icons, and links to existing blog posts
- Inserted between `<Hero />` and `<Services />` in `app/page.tsx` — now the very first content below the hero is informational, not company-focused
- Committed as Run #28 (`8827454`)

**What changed:** The homepage now immediately answers "how does a septic system work?", "what are warning signs?", "how much does it cost?", "what happens if I never pump?", "what can't I flush?", and "why does it back up after rain?" — the six most common homeowner questions — before ever talking about services. Includes a footer link to `/resources` for deeper exploration.
[2026-02-21 17:56:07] Run #1 finished
[2026-02-21 17:56:12] Run #2 starting (model: sonnet)
Done. Here's what was implemented:

**Run #29: Septic Health Check diagnostic section**

A new `SepticHealthCheck` component inserted between the Q&A hub and the Services section. It's a 3-column self-assessment tool:

- **All Clear** (green) — signals of a healthy system with a link to the pumping schedule guide
- **Schedule Service** (amber) — yellow-flag situations linking to the warning signs article  
- **Call Now** (red) — emergency signals linking to the emergency guide

Each column has a status badge, icon, a headline, 5 diagnostic signals, and a "read more" link to the relevant blog post. A footer note links to `/resources` and `/faq`.

**Why this is high-priority:** The page's middle section was previously 4 consecutive company-focused sections (Services → WhyChooseUs → Testimonials → ServiceArea). This new section breaks that up and gives the page a "homeowner resource" feel right after the Q&A cards — the first thing a visitor sees after reading quick answers is "now identify your situation," not "here are our services."

[2026-02-21 18:00:48] Run #1 starting (model: sonnet)
Done. Here's what changed:

**Structural reorder in `app/page.tsx`** — moved `<RecentPosts />` (Septic System Guides) and `<FAQ />` from positions 9 and 8 up to positions 4 and 5, right after the HealthCheck diagnostic.

The homepage now has a clean two-part structure:

| Position | Section | Character |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hero | Orientation |
| 2 | AnswerHub | Informational |
| 3 | HealthCheck | Informational |
| 4 | **Guides** (moved) | Informational |
| 5 | **FAQ** (moved) | Informational |
| 6 | Services | Company |
| 7 | WhyChooseUs | Company |
| 8 | Testimonials | Company |
| 9 | ServiceArea | Company |
| 10 | Contact | Conversion |

A visitor now reads through five consecutive educational sections before encountering any service/sales content — the structural signature of an informational site rather than a company brochure.
[2026-02-21 18:02:22] Run #1 finished
[2026-02-21 18:02:27] Run #2 starting (model: sonnet)
Done. Removed `WhyChooseUs` from the homepage.

**What changed:** The "Why Choose Eagle Septic?" section — a stats bar (18+ years, 4,200+ tanks, 24/7, Licensed & Insured) plus 6 company marketing pitch cards — has been removed from the homepage.

**Why this was the highest-priority goal:** It was the most purely promotional block on the page with zero informational value. A homeowner researching septic systems gets nothing useful from "Why Choose Us?" copy. The homepage now flows: informational answers → diagnostic tool → blog posts → FAQ → services → reviews → coverage → contact — with no hard marketing pitch interrupting the information-first experience.

[2026-02-21 18:03:39] Run #3 starting (model: sonnet)
Two targeted changes committed as Run #32:

1. **Hero height**: `min-h-[520px]` → `min-h-[380px]` — saves 140px of company-only viewport. On a typical 900px laptop, the HomepageAnswerHub Q&As are now partially visible on first load, immediately signalling "informational resource" rather than "service company."

2. **Secondary CTA**: "Get a Free Estimate" → "Browse Septic Guides" → `/resources` — the primary phone CTA stays, but the second button now drives visitors toward educational content instead of a service conversion funnel. This is the most visible signal of intent on the entire page.
[2026-02-21 18:06:56] Run #3 finished
[2026-02-21 18:07:01] Run #4 starting (model: sonnet)
Done. Single focused change committed.

**Run #33 — Hero CTA hierarchy swap**

"Browse Septic Guides" is now the `btn-primary` (green, visually dominant) and appears first. "Call {PHONE}" is demoted to `btn-secondary` (outlined) and appears second.

The above-the-fold first impression now reads: *learn here* — not *hire us*. Every other informational section below (AnswerHub, SepticHealthCheck, RecentPosts) already supported this framing; the Hero was the only element contradicting it.
[2026-02-21 18:08:52] Run #4 finished
[2026-02-21 18:08:57] Run #5 starting (model: sonnet)
Done. The change moves `<RecentPosts />` to be the first content section after the Hero.

**What changed:**
- `Hero` → `RecentPosts` → `HomepageAnswerHub` → `SepticHealthCheck` → `FAQ` → `Services` → ...
- Was: `Hero` → `HomepageAnswerHub` → `SepticHealthCheck` → `RecentPosts` → `FAQ` → ...

**Why this is the highest-priority goal:**
- Blog guide cards (thumbnail photos, "Education" / "Maintenance" category pills, "8 min read" tags, "Read guide →" CTAs) are the single strongest visual indicator that a page is an informational resource — not a company marketing site. Visitors now see that signal in the first scroll.
- Fixes the visual merge: `SepticHealthCheck` and `RecentPosts` both had `bg-gray-50`, making them look like one continuous section. Now they're separated by `HomepageAnswerHub` (`bg-white`).
- Creates near-perfect background alternation across all informational sections: `dark → gray-50 → white → gray-50 → white → gray-50` — each section is visually distinct.
