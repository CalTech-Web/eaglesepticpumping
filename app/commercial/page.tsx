A small office building on a 1,500-gallon system might need annual pumping. We assess your specific situation and recommend a schedule accordingly — we don't apply a one-size-fits-all formula.",

These records are formatted to satisfy Stanislaus County and Merced County environmental health requirements. We can also provide annual system inspection letters on request.",

    question: "Can you service our system outside of business hours?",

    question: "Do you offer maintenance contracts?",

Contracts include a set number of scheduled pump-outs per year, one full annual inspection, compliance documentation, and priority emergency response. Pricing is fixed for the contract term — no surprise charges.",

  {
    question: "What's the largest tank you can pump?",
    answer:
      "Our vacuum trucks handle tanks up to 10,000+ gallons in a single visit for most standard waste types. For very large agricultural or industrial tanks, we coordinate multiple truck visits or staged pumping. Contact us with your tank specifications and we'll confirm capacity and logistics.",
